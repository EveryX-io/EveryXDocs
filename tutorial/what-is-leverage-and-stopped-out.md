# What is Leverage and Stopped Out

## How to Place a Trade

Objective: This guide outlines the step-by-step process for opening a leveraged position on an Event.

#### Step 1: Select Market & Buy

1. Navigate to the Event you wish to trade.
2. Identify your preferred Outcome (e.g., YES, Team A).
3. Click the Buy option.

#### Step 2: Configure Leverage & Size

Once the trading panel opens, configure your position size and risk:

1. Select Leverage: Choose your desired multiplier.
   * Options: +20, +50, or Max Leverage (+100).
   * _Example:_ If you input $20 collateral and select Max Leverage, your total exposure becomes $200 (10x).
2. Input Amount: Enter the cash amount you wish to risk.

#### Step 3: Review Risk Metrics

Before confirming, review the dynamic data calculated by the engine:

* Projected P\&L: The estimated payout amount if your prediction wins.
* Stop Level: The specific probability percentage at which your position will be liquidated (automatically closed) to prevent further loss.
* Market Impact: The percentage by which your specific trade will shift the current market probability.

#### Step 4: Confirm Execution

1. Click the Confirm button to execute the trade.

> Danger: Once you press Confirm, the transaction is final. You cannot cancel a trade after execution; you must wait for the event resolution or manually close the position (if early exit is supported).

#### Step 5: Verify & Monitor

1. Look for the "Transaction Successful" notification.
2.  Navigate to the Portfolio tab to view your positions.

    * Active: Trades currently live.
    * Past: History of trades that are Won, Lost, or Pending Resolution.
