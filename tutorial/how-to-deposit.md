## How to Deposit Funds

Objective: This guide outlines the process for funding your EveryX account using either a Web3 wallet (like MetaMask) or a manual transfer from an exchange.

### Step 1: Access the Deposit Page

1. Click the Menu icon (three lines) in the top navigation bar.
2. Select Portfolio from the dropdown options.
3. Click the Go to Deposit button located near your Cash Balance.

### Step 2: Select Network

Before proceeding, you must choose the blockchain network you wish to use.

* Options: Polygon or BSC (Binance Smart Chain).

> Warning: Ensure you select the correct network. Sending funds via a network that is not selected here (e.g., sending via Ethereum Mainnet when BSC is selected) may result in permanent loss of funds.

### Step 3: Choose Deposit Method

You can deposit using one of two methods:

**Method A: Web3 Wallet (MetaMask)**

_Best for users who already have a browser wallet connected._

1. Enter Amount: Input the specific US Dollar amount you wish to deposit.
2. Connect: Click Proceed or Connect Wallet if prompted.
3. Confirm: Review the gas fee and total amount in your wallet pop-up (e.g., MetaMask notification) and click Confirm.

**Method B: Exchange / Manual Transfer**

_Best for users sending funds from an app like ByBit, Binance, or a mobile wallet._

1. Get Address: On the EveryX deposit screen, locate your unique Wallet Address or the QR Code.
2. Initiate Withdrawal: Open your external exchange app (e.g., ByBit) and select Withdraw.
3. Paste & Match:
   * Paste the EveryX address (or scan the QR code).
   * Crucial: Select the same network you chose in Step 2 (e.g., if you chose BSC on EveryX, select BSC (BEP20) on your exchange).
4. Send: Enter the amount and confirm the withdrawal from your exchange.

### Step 4: Verify Transaction

1. Wait for the blockchain confirmation (usually a few seconds to minutes).
2. Click View History on the deposit page to see a log of your transactions.
3. Check your Cash Balance to ensure the funds have arrived.
