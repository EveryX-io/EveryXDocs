# How EveryX Referral Works

## How to Join the Referral Program

Objective: This guide explains how to access the EveryX referral dashboard, share your unique link, and claim cash rewards for inviting new users.

### Step 1: Access the Dashboard

1. Locate the Invite Friends button on the main interface.
2. Clicking this will redirect you to the Refer & Earn Dashboard, where you can track all your referral activities.

### Step 2: Get Your Link

1. Inside the dashboard, click the Invite Friends button again.
2. You will see two key items to share:
   * Referral Link: A direct URL to send to friends.
   * Referral Code: A unique code friends can enter manually during signup.

> Info: The Reward: For every successful referral, you get $20 and your friend gets $10.

### Step 3: Monitor Referral Status

To check if your friends have signed up, click the Refer Status button. You will see two categories:

* Pending: The user has signed up but has not yet been verified or has not made their first transaction.
* Completed: The user is verified and has completed at least one transaction. You can only claim rewards for "Completed" referrals.

### Step 4: Claim Your Rewards

Once a referral moves to "Completed," you can claim your $20 prize using one of two methods:

1. Method A: Click the Green Claim Button next to the specific completed referral in the status list.
2. Method B: Go to the main Refer a Friend Dashboard and click the $20 Icon representing the reward.

### Step 5: Review Rules

For detailed terms and conditions, click the Referral Rules button on the dashboard. This section explains eligibility requirements and restrictions to ensure fair play.
