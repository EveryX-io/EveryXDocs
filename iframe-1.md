I didn't receive any content to convert. Please paste the page's markdown or HTML (or a link to the page) that you want optimized for GitBook, and I'll transform it following the rules (tabs for package managers, steppers for numbered multi-step lists, FAQ → expandables, remove nav, etc.).

If helpful, you can also tell me:

* The target filename or title to use.
* Any images that should remain as-is (especially base64).
* Whether I should keep or remove code block language hints.
