# What is EveryX?

EveryX is a different kind of prediction market – built from the ground up to support built-in leverage and real-money trading on event probabilities. Users trade on probabilities of outcomes in sports, crypto, politics, weather, economics, markets, disasters and more!

#### What Makes EveryX Different?

* Clear stop-loss behavior- users always know the maximum they can lose and positions are cut with zero slippage
* No liquidity constraints- with our trading pool logic, there is no need to match your order against other users – nor any market makers. That means your order flow cannot be picked off.
* You control your risk- feeling cautious? Dial down the leverage and choose a stop-level that you’re comfortable with.&#x20;
* True predictions- the traded value flowing into each event dictates the outcome’s probabilities. When users trade their convictions, the probabilities necessarily fall into line.
* Multi-Outcome markets- our system was built with choice in mind – no need to trade only on simple Yes/No outcomes.
* Trades executed in an instant- our order matching logic processes trades in sub millisecond speeds.
