I didn't receive any content or instructions. Do you want me to import a web page into GitBook and convert it to optimized markdown? If so, please provide one of the following:

* The URL of the page to import, or
* The raw HTML/markdown content (paste it here), or
* A file (you can paste the content) and any special instructions (e.g., keep images, split into multiple pages, convert package manager commands to tabs, etc.)

Helpful details to include (optional):

* Desired page title in GitBook (if different from the source)
* Whether to convert long sequential numbered lists into a stepper
* Whether to turn FAQs into expandables
* Any content to omit beyond the standard rules (logos, nav, unrelated footers)

Once you provide the page or content, I’ll convert it into GitBook-optimized markdown following the guidelines.
