### How is EveryX different from other prediction markets?

The primary differentiator of the EveryX platform is Leverage.

Unlike traditional prediction markets that typically operate on a 1:1 basis, EveryX allows traders to utilize leverage to amplify their market positions. This mechanic enables users with high conviction to execute larger plays and maximize capital efficiency.
