  At EveryX, we distinguish between Bonus Credits (rewards provided during
  community trading events) and Withdrawable Profits. It is important to
  understand how these two asset types interact within you

# How Funding Works

### Bonus Credits vs. Profits

The EveryX system is designed to ensure that trading incentives do not restrict your access to your earnings.

* **Independence**: Profits are withdrawable independently of bonus credits.
* **System Logic**: Possession of bonus credits does not lock your account or prevent profit withdrawals.

**Policy Note**: This separation of funds is a core system rule that has been in effect since September. For the full historical context, please refer to our [original documentation](https://everyx.io/news/68db8c67e37df879d53ad7b9).

### Withdrawal Integrity

The EveryX platform supports competitive trading culture by ensuring valid profits remain accessible. There are no system-imposed restrictions on withdrawing profits generated from valid trades, regardless of active community event bonuses.
