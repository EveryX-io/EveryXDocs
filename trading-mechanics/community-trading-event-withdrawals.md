# Community Trading Event Withdrawals

### Root Cause Analysis

This was identified as a communication error, not a system failure or an intentional restriction on withdrawals. The guidance provided did not reflect the actual mechanics of the EveryX system.

System Logic: As outlined in our [September Documentation](https://everyx.io/news/68db8c67e37df879d53ad7b9), profits have always been withdrawable independently of bonus.

### Resolution

* Correction: We have corrected the internal communication protocols to ensure this error does not recur.
* Restoration: All affected profits have been fully restored and are immediately withdrawable.

EveryX remains committed to supporting traders and maintaining the integrity of the platform.
